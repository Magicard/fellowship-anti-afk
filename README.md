# wow-anti-afk
Simple anti afk script in python3 for world of warcraft, to avoid queues given release of WoW Classic.

# Install
- Install python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Add python3 to your "Path" environment variable (https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/)
- Clone repo or copy/pastw wow.py to wow.py on your local storage

# Usage
- Open command prompt (cmd.exe in search bar)
- Navigate to directory containing wow.py
- Run `python wow.py`

The script will randomly send arrow keys/space bar (jump) when World of Warcraft is the active window. World of Warcraft MUST be the active window (so you can't use your PC for other things in the meantime), script is really only useful while you are away from your computer and can leave it running with WoW open.
